The New Year is coming and you have decided to decorate your home. But simple 
garlands and Christmas decorations are so boring, so you have decided to use your programing skills and create something really cool and original.
Your task is to create class Lamp() and method light() which make lamp to glow by one of four color in the sequence - (‘Green’, ‘Red’, ‘Blue’, ‘Yellow’). When the light() method is used at the first time the color should be 'Green', at the second time - 'Red' and so on.
If the current color is 'Yellow', the next color should be 'Green' and so on.

In this mission you can use <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern'>State</a> design pattern. It is used in the situations where object should change self behaviour depending on the internal state.

<strong>Example</strong>:
<pre class="brush: python">
lamp_1 = Lamp()
lamp_2 = Lamp()

lamp_1.light() #Green
lamp_1.light() #Red
lamp_2.light() #Green
    
lamp_1.light() == "Blue"
lamp_1.light() == "Yellow"
lamp_1.light() == "Green"
lamp_2.light() == "Red"
lamp_2.light() == "Blue"
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong>a few lines indicating the number of lamp inclusions.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong>color of the lamp.

<p class="for_info_only">
    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    To implement objects with mutable behavior.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    4 colors: Green, Red, Blue, Yellow.
